# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions

## Objective

You are building an **AI Prompt Generator** web app for developers to help them craft high-quality prompts for AI-powered coding assistants.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **AI Integration**: AI SDK using **Groq** as the model provider  
  Reference: https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/groq

## UI Structure

Build a clean, responsive UI with the following structure:

### Input Form

- **Title**: Text input – short title of the prompt.
- **Stack**: A text input that supports multiple technologies.
  - User types technologies one by one, separated by comma or by confirming with Tab.
  - As the user types, show an **inline autocomplete suggestion** (ghost text inside the input) based on a hardcoded list of common technologies (e.g., "react", "vue", "nextjs", "tailwind", etc.).
  - Pressing Tab or ArrowRight should confirm the suggestion.
  - Each confirmed item becomes a "pill" or tag displayed before the input.
  - Prevent duplicate entries.
  - Allow removing tags with an "x" or Backspace.
- **Requirements**: Multiline textarea – describes what the prompt should accomplish.
- **Additional Note**: Optional textarea – for context, constraints, or examples.

### Action Buttons

- **Generate Prompt**: Sends input to the AI SDK (Groq provider) to generate a complete developer prompt.
- **Clear All**: Resets all input fields to default/empty.

### Output Area

- **Generated Prompt**: Textarea or read-only styled block displaying the generated prompt.
- **Enhance Prompt**: Sends the generated prompt back to the AI SDK for further refinement.

## Requirements

- Use `shadcn/ui` components where applicable (`<Input>`, `<Textarea>`, `<Button>`, etc.).
- Handle state cleanly using React (e.g., `useState`, `useForm`).
- Use AI SDK to handle prompt generation and enhancement, specifying `provider: "groq"`.
- Ensure the UI is intuitive, accessible, and optimized for developer workflows.

## Goal

Enable developers to quickly generate and improve prompts for tools such as GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, and other AI code assistants.

I'm participating in a 30-minute coding competition. The one who makes the application the fastest will be the winner.

Build a [App name] using [Framework] with [Styling library].

Features:

- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]

Prioritize core functionality and clean UI. No extra explanations. Just the full working code in a single file or as simple as possible.
